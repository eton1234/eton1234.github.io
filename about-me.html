        <h1> Hi, Ethan here!  </h1>
        <p> I'm a junior engineering student here at Northwestern University majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Data Science. I have a particular interest 
            in innovative EduTech software, and software that is user-centered at its core. I also have taken up an interested in systems, specifically
            in embedded systems programming, and OS level development. I feel like my journey in Software Engineering has just begun however,
            and I am excited to learn more in other areas! 
        </p>
        <p>  Outside of class, I enjoy watching the GS Warriors, self-studying Mandarin, and hanging out with friends.
             I also enjoy playing piano and violin, both of which I have played for over a decade. 
        </p>
        <h1> I'm involved in an assortment of activites on campus! </h1>
            <h3> Research Assistant, <a href="https://tiilt.northwestern.edu/">TIILT Lab</a></h3>
            <p>At the TIILT lab, I am designing a web application with the end goal of teaching music theory in a more interactive and accessible way.
                I've been researching rhythm identification with the librosa and madmom Python libraries. I've also conducted 
                    expert interviews and user research as part of our user-centered design process.</p>
            <h3> Northwestern Dance Marathon (<a href="https://www.nudm.org/">NUDM</a>) Tech and Analytics Team</h3>
                <p>
                    With NUDM, I'm developing a client facing mobile app which serves thousands of students. The app mainly involves an event management interface as well as a fundraising leaderboard.
                    We are working with React Native and Firebase in an agile environment</li>
                </p>

            <h3>DAQ Team, <a href="https://northwesternformularacing.com/about-us/">Northwestern Formula Racing</a></h3>
                <p>
                    NU Formula Racing builds a car from scratch for competition in the collegiate Formula FSAE tournament.
                    I've had the opportunity to learn about embedded systems, different hardware protocols and the interface between software and hardware! 
                    Specifically, I wrote and tested ESP32 firmware (C++) which sends onboard GPS and IMU sensor data to the car's CAN bus at a periodic rate.
