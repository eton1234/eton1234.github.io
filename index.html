                <p> I'm a junior engineering student here at <b>Northwestern University</b> majoring in <b>Computer Science</b> with a
                    minor in Data Science. I'm particularly interested
                    in innovative EduTech software, or software that is user-centered at its core. I also have taken up
                    an interested in systems, specifically
                    in embedded systems development and Operating Systems. I feel like my journey in Software
                    Engineering has just begun however,
                    and I am excited to learn more in other areas!

                <p> Outside of class, I enjoy watching the GS Warriors, self-studying Mandarin, and hanging out with
                    friends. 
                    I also enjoy playing piano and violin, both of which I have played for over a decade.
                    Recently I installed linux so I have been having fun with that :)

            <h2> Research Assistant, <a href="https://tiilt.northwestern.edu/" target="_blank">TIILT Lab</a></h2>
            <p>At the TIILT lab, I am designing a web application with the end goal of teaching music theory in a more
                interactive and accessible way.
                I've been researching rhythm identification with the librosa and madmom Python libraries. I've also
                conducted
                expert interviews and user research as part of our user-centered design process.</p>
            <h2> Northwestern Dance Marathon (<a href="https://www.nudm.org/" target="_blank">NUDM</a>) Tech and
                Analytics Team</h2>
            <p>
                With NUDM, I'm developing a client facing mobile app which serves thousands of students. The app mainly
                involves an event management interface as well as a fundraising leaderboard.
                We are working with React Native and Firebase in an agile environment</li>

            <p>
                NU Formula Racing builds a car from scratch for competition in the collegiate Formula FSAE tournament.
                I've had the opportunity to learn about embedded systems, different hardware protocols and the interface
                between software and hardware!
                Specifically, I wrote and tested ESP32 firmware (C++) which sends onboard GPS and IMU sensor data to the
                car's CAN bus at a periodic rate.
