                    <h1> About me </h1>
                    <p> I'm a 3rd year student at <b>Northwestern University</b> majoring in <b>Computer Science</b> with a
                        minor in Data Science.
                    </p>

                     <p>
                        One of my passions is thinking about the different software tools that 
                        could be developed to help augment learning. Over the summer, I worked on an interface for reading in a foreign language. 
                        Creating accessible and user
                        focused software is something I really value. 
                    </p>
                    <p> I'm primarily interested in computer systems in school. Learning about and developing projects related to database intenerals, the internet, and operating systems has been fascinating to me.
                
        
                    </p>
                    <p> Outside of class, I am learning how to boulder and I love to self-study Mandarin.
                        I also enjoy playing piano and violin, both of which I have played for over a decade. Fun fact: I took these photos around my college campus!

                <h2> Research Assistant, <a href="https://tiilt.northwestern.edu/" target="_blank">TIILT Lab</a></h2>
                <p>At the TIILT lab, I am designing a web application with the end goal of teaching music theory in a more
                    interactive and engaging way.
                    So far I've conducted interviews with professors at the Bienen School of Music as part of our user-centered design process. I'm also researching
                    music information retrieval and brainstorming new ways to visualize aspects of theory.

                <p>
                    With NUDM, I'm developing a client facing mobile app which serves thousands of students. The app mainly
                    involves an event management interface as well as a fundraising leaderboard.
                    We are working with React Native (TypeScript), Redux, and Firebase in an Agile environment</li>

                        Racing</a></h2>
                <p>
                    NU Formula Racing builds a car from scratch for competition in the collegiate Formula FSAE tournament. I've learnd a lot about the field of embedded systems in Formula.
                    Specifically, I wrote and tested ESP32 firmware (C++) which sends onboard GPS and IMU sensor data via the
                    car's CAN bus at a periodic rate. I also wrote a driver interfacing between the car's motor controller and various entities that wish to receive data and transmit requests
