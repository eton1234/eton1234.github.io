                    <h1> About me </h1>
                    <p> I'm a junior engineering student here at <b>Northwestern University</b> majoring in <b>Computer Science</b> with a
                        minor in Data Science. I'm particularly interested in EduTech and software that is user-centered at its core. I also have taken up
                        an interested in systems, specifically
                        in Embedded Systems and Operating Systems. My journey in Software
                        Engineering has just begun however,
                        and I am eager to branch out!
                    </p>
                    <p> I enjoy watching the GS Warriors and self-studying Mandarin.
                        I also enjoy playing piano and violin, both of which I have played for over a decade.
                        Recently I installed linux and have been messing around with that :)

                <p>At the TIILT lab, I am designing a web application with the end goal of teaching music theory in a more
                    interactive and accessible way.
                    I've been researching rhythm identification with the librosa and madmom Python libraries. I've also
                    conducted
                    expert interviews and user research as part of our user-centered design process.

                <p>
                    With NUDM, I'm developing a client facing mobile app which serves thousands of students. The app mainly
                    involves an event management interface as well as a fundraising leaderboard.
                    We are working with React Native and Firebase in an agile environment</li>

                    NU Formula Racing builds a car from scratch for competition in the collegiate Formula FSAE tournament.
                    I've had the opportunity to learn about embedded systems, different hardware protocols and the interface
                    between software and hardware!
                    Specifically, I wrote and tested ESP32 firmware (C++) which sends onboard GPS and IMU sensor data to the
                    car's CAN bus at a periodic rate.
