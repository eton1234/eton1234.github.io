                    <ul> <li>Trying to read in a foreign language like Chinese is a tough task.
                        Besides memorizing the thousands of characters that exist, it is a confusing task to figure out which characters in a sequence
                        make up a word: Chinese words can be composed of 1-4 characters, making it ambiguous to tell when a word starts and ends.. </li>
                        <li>
                        To circumvent these struggles, the Kanbooks IOS E-reader prototype automatically tokenizes page content by word, highlights
                        unknown words for faster identification, and provides on the fly translation and pinyin
                        romanizations for each word token. </li>
